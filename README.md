  Analysis:-
<img width="800" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0651c0b6-7870-4fe6-8498-e23c643e2618" />
**Sector Dominance**
Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities is by far the largest recipient of government R&D funding, receiving over ₹1,000 crores annually
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing ranks second, consistently receiving ₹300-400 crores
These two sectors alone account for nearly 75% of all R&D investment
**Investment Trends (2018-21)**
Overall decline: Total R&D expenditure decreased by 5.3% over the 3-year period
Mixed performance: While some sectors grew (like "Others" +14.7%), traditional sectors declined
Manufacturing struggles: Food products and electrical equipment sectors saw significant cuts (28-40% decline)
**Resource Concentration**
High inequality: Top 5 sectors capture ~85% of total R&D budget
Limited diversity: Investment is heavily concentrated rather than spread across many sectors
Strategic focus: Government clearly prioritizes science/technology and agriculture over manufacturing
**Key Patterns**
Service sector resilience: Scientific and technical services maintained strong funding despite overall cuts
Traditional sector support: Agriculture remains a consistent priority
Manufacturing concern: Declining investment in industrial R&D could impact innovation capacity
Bottom Line:
The bar graphs reveal a concentrated, strategically-focused R&D investment approach that prioritizes scientific research and agriculture while reducing support for manufacturing sectors. This suggests a shift toward knowledge-based and food security priorities in government R&D policy.
