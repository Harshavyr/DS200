**1. Bar Plot**
## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **"Government Expenditure on R&D"**.

**Sector Dominance**
Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities is by far the largest recipient of government R&D funding, receiving over ₹1,000 crores annually
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing ranks second, consistently receiving ₹300-400 crores
These two sectors alone account for nearly 75% of all R&D investment

**Investment Trends (2018-21)**
Overall decline: Total R&D expenditure decreased by 5.3% over the 3-year period
Mixed performance: While some sectors grew (like "Others" +14.7%), traditional sectors declined
Manufacturing struggles: Food products and electrical equipment sectors saw significant cuts (28-40% decline)

**Resource Concentration**
High inequality: Top 5 sectors capture ~85% of total R&D budget
Limited diversity: Investment is heavily concentrated rather than spread across many sectors
Strategic focus: Government clearly prioritizes science/technology and agriculture over manufacturing

**Key Patterns**
Service sector resilience: Scientific and technical services maintained strong funding despite overall cuts
Traditional sector support: Agriculture remains a consistent priority
Manufacturing concern: Declining investment in industrial R&D could impact innovation capacity

**Bottom Line:**
The bar graphs reveal a concentrated, strategically-focused R&D investment approach that prioritizes scientific research and agriculture while reducing support for manufacturing sectors. This suggests a shift toward knowledge-based and food security priorities in government R&D policy.

Inferences from PM2.5 Box Plot Data Analysis

The box plot analysis of PM2.5 pollution data across India's top 10 cities reveals several critical data-driven inferences:
The analysis examines PM2.5 pollution levels across India's top 10 most polluted cities using box plot visualization. The study reveals critical air quality patterns, variability in pollution levels, and health implications for urban populations. All analyzed cities demonstrate PM2.5 concentrations that significantly exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, indicating a widespread public health crisis.

Methodology
The analysis utilized city-wise pollution data to create box plots comparing PM2.5 distributions across the top 10 cities ranked by average pollution levels. Box plots were selected as they effectively display:

Central tendency (median values)

Data spread (interquartile ranges)

Variability patterns (box heights)

Extreme values and outliers

Comparative pollution profiles across cities


**Pollution Distribution Patterns**: The data shows Bhiwadi as the most polluted city with an average of 195.0 μg/m³, followed by Ghaziabad (148.0 μg/m³), Delhi (138.0 μg/m³), Greater Noida (132.5 μg/m³), and Noida (135.5 μg/m³). All cities demonstrate PM2.5 levels that exceed WHO guidelines (15 μg/m³) by factors ranging from 4.5x to 13x.

**Variability Insights**: The box plot dimensions reveal distinct pollution behavior patterns. Bhiwadi exhibits the highest variability with extreme fluctuations (150-220 μg/m³ range), indicating inconsistent pollution sources. Delhi shows significant variation (50-165 μg/m³), while Ghaziabad displays a narrower distribution, suggesting more consistent pollution levels. Cities with taller boxes demonstrate greater day-to-day pollution variability.

**Statistical Characteristics**: All analyzed cities show median PM2.5 levels exceeding 50 μg/m³, with interquartile ranges varying significantly across cities. The presence of outliers in multiple cities indicates occasional extreme pollution episodes beyond normal ranges.
