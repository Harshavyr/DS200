**1. Bar Plot**
## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **"Government Expenditure on R&D"**.

**Sector Dominance**
Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities is by far the largest recipient of government R&D funding, receiving over ₹1,000 crores annually
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing ranks second, consistently receiving ₹300-400 crores
These two sectors alone account for nearly 75% of all R&D investment

**Investment Trends (2018-21)**
Overall decline: Total R&D expenditure decreased by 5.3% over the 3-year period
Mixed performance: While some sectors grew (like "Others" +14.7%), traditional sectors declined
Manufacturing struggles: Food products and electrical equipment sectors saw significant cuts (28-40% decline)

**Resource Concentration**
High inequality: Top 5 sectors capture ~85% of total R&D budget
Limited diversity: Investment is heavily concentrated rather than spread across many sectors
Strategic focus: Government clearly prioritizes science/technology and agriculture over manufacturing

**Key Patterns**
Service sector resilience: Scientific and technical services maintained strong funding despite overall cuts
Traditional sector support: Agriculture remains a consistent priority
Manufacturing concern: Declining investment in industrial R&D could impact innovation capacity

**Bottom Line:**
The bar graphs reveal a concentrated, strategically-focused R&D investment approach that prioritizes scientific research and agriculture while reducing support for manufacturing sectors. This suggests a shift toward knowledge-based and food security priorities in government R&D policy.

Inferences from PM2.5 Box Plot Data Analysis

The box plot analysis of PM2.5 pollution data across India's top 10 cities reveals several critical data-driven inferences:
The analysis examines PM2.5 pollution levels across India's top 10 most polluted cities using box plot visualization. The study reveals critical air quality patterns, variability in pollution levels, and health implications for urban populations. All analyzed cities demonstrate PM2.5 concentrations that significantly exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, indicating a widespread public health crisis.

Methodology
The analysis utilized city-wise pollution data to create box plots comparing PM2.5 distributions across the top 10 cities ranked by average pollution levels. Box plots were selected as they effectively display:

Central tendency (median values)

Data spread (interquartile ranges)

Variability patterns (box heights)

Extreme values and outliers

Comparative pollution profiles across cities


**Pollution Distribution Patterns**: The data shows Bhiwadi as the most polluted city with an average of 195.0 μg/m³, followed by Ghaziabad (148.0 μg/m³), Delhi (138.0 μg/m³), Greater Noida (132.5 μg/m³), and Noida (135.5 μg/m³). All cities demonstrate PM2.5 levels that exceed WHO guidelines (15 μg/m³) by factors ranging from 4.5x to 13x.

**Variability Insights**: The box plot dimensions reveal distinct pollution behavior patterns. Bhiwadi exhibits the highest variability with extreme fluctuations (150-220 μg/m³ range), indicating inconsistent pollution sources. Delhi shows significant variation (50-165 μg/m³), while Ghaziabad displays a narrower distribution, suggesting more consistent pollution levels. Cities with taller boxes demonstrate greater day-to-day pollution variability.

**Statistical Characteristics**: All analyzed cities show median PM2.5 levels exceeding 50 μg/m³, with interquartile ranges varying significantly across cities. The presence of outliers in multiple cities indicates occasional extreme pollution episodes beyond normal ranges.

**3. Scatter Plot**
## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **"Girls and Boys Enrollement in higher education "**.

Overall Gender Distribution
Uttar Pradesh dominates with highest enrollment (~800K boys, ~650K girls) but shows male bias.
Maharashtra follows as second largest (~500K boys, ~500K girls) with better balance.
Strong positive correlation (0.9+) between boys and girls enrollment across states.
Gender Parity Patterns.

**States Above Parity Line (More Girls than Boys):**

Tamil Nadu - Clear female advantage in senior secondary education.
Kerala - Progressive southern state showing girls' educational success.
Andhra Pradesh - Moderate female advantage.
West Bengal - Slight female advantage.

**States Below Parity Line (More Boys than Girls):**

Uttar Pradesh - Significant male bias despite highest enrollment.
Bihar - Traditional male preference in education.
Rajasthan - Conservative attitudes affecting girls' education.
Madhya Pradesh - Male-dominated enrollment patterns.

**Key Regional Insights**

**South India Performance**:

Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh show pro-female enrollment.
Better gender equality in education access.
Cultural factors supporting girls' education.

**North India Challenges:**
UP, Bihar, Rajasthan show male bias.
Traditional gender roles limiting girls' access.
Need for targeted interventions.

**Northeast & Small States**:

Generally balanced enrollment.
Smaller absolute numbers but good gender parity.
Progressive educational policies.

**Policy Implications**

Uttar Pradesh: Despite large numbers, significant gender gap exists.
Bihar & Rajasthan: Traditional mindsets need addressing.
Focus on rural areas where disparities are likely higher.

**Statistical Highlights**
Total National: Boys slightly outnumber girls in Class XII.
State Distribution: ~15-18 states show male advantage, ~12-15 show female advantage.
Correlation: Strong 0.9+ correlation suggests systemic factors affect both genders similarly.
Bubble Size: Larger states drive national trends but smaller states often show better balance.

**Research Implications**
Educational Dropouts: Why do fewer girls reach Class XII in certain states?
Cultural Factors: Marriage age, safety concerns, economic priorities.
Infrastructure: School availability, transportation, sanitation facilities.
Economic: Opportunity cost of education vs. early employment/marriage.
This visualization effectively reveals that while India has made progress in primary education gender parity, significant challenges remain at the senior secondary level, particularly in large northern states that could drive national policy changes if addressed effectively.
